RESTest - iOS app
=================

This is an iOS application that uses the RESTful API server I made with Node, which can be found here on GitHub. It only has a tableview which makes a GET request and another view which makes a PUT request to my server.

I am using this repo to get a better understanding of how to make HTTP requests in Objective-C.
